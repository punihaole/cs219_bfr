1. Copy ccn_exp.py and __init__.py to ~/.core/myservices/ (or modify existing file)
2. make
3. bin/ccnud (must be run before the routing daemon)
4. bin/ccnumrd

Use the apps/bin for testing. Each individual daemon and the shared library (libcon) have some tests executables, but many of these are deprecated.
Running ccnud -t or ccnumrd -t should work, however.
